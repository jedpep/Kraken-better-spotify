# Better Spotify Album Art

Enables users to display their currently playing song/podcast on their Kraken LCD devices.

Took inspiration from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NZXT/comments/po2bjy/made_a_concept_for_how_spotify_would_look_on_the/)
Made this cuz i didn't like the default spotify one on nzxt cam

## Installation

To run this, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your computer.

## Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Set up a Spotify Developer account and create a new Spotify application. Note down the client ID and client secret.
Create a new file called ".env.local" in the directory/folder of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-jwt-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
```

For the JWT_SECRET, you can use this website to generate one, [jwtgenerator](https://www.javainuse.com/jwtgenerator) (it can be anything and it'll work)

Run the development server using `yarn dev`.

After running the command, go to the NZXT Cam app, and select "Web Integration" on your LCD Display, after that click on Custom, and then Edit.
Paste "http://localhost:3000/ (or whatever u changed it to in the .env.local file), and then press Configure and login using your spotify account.
